## What is FTLE?

FTLE (Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent) is a method of quantifying material flow, whereby you identify the most robust structures which act as the finite-time analogues of stable and unstable manifolds (See [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_coherent_structure) ).

## How do we calculate FTLE?

To compute the FTLE field 


## Why you should use FTLE on your flow dataset 

Structures identified using LCS methods are objective, as in they are invariant to time-dependent rigid rotations and  translations. They are also mathematically shown to be the most robust structures in the flow, thereby making it robust to noise.
