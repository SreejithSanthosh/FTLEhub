There a growing corpus of literature highlights the role of LCS structures identified using FTLE methods in biological flows, primarily in morphogenesis. We list some of the recent developements and must-reads so that you can get a sense of where it has been applied and how it is interpreted and how it has biological significance. 

- [Dynamic Morphoskeletons in Development](https://www.mattiaserra.com/_files/ugd/297716_66be52fd4f954943b0243f0e88c75084.pdf) : This work from M. Serra et al, introduces the concept of LCS into analyzing the flows generated in morphogenetic flows during Chick and Drosophila gastrulation. The paper also goes through concepts of why FTLE based methods are ideal to uncover hidden structure in the flow.
