The code for computing FTLE for flow on curved surface are given at [source](https://github.com/SreejithSanthosh/curvedSurfaceFTLE.git). We will provide a detailed tutorial on how to use this code for flow on curved surfaces. To understand the mathematical background and methods used to compute FTLE on curved surface, we refer you to the accompanying manuscript [S. Molawi et al](https://www.mattiaserra.com/_files/ugd/297716_cdb02b2313d54470850bf03d27bd1149.pdf).
