There a growing corpus of literature highlights the role of LCS structures identified using FTLE methods in active flows, primarily in active nematic flow. We list some of the recent developements and must-reads so that you can get a sense of where it has been applied and how it is interpreted and how it has physical significance. 

- [Defect-mediated dynamics of coherent structres in active nematics](https://www.mattiaserra.com/_files/ugd/297716_386711d929574f0abc01a7abdaab2ef0.pdf) : This work from M. Serra et al, introduces the concept of LCS into analyzing the flows generated in active flows generated by active nematic systems. The paper goes on to analyze and correlate the motion of the LCS structures and couples it to the nematic orientational field. The paper also highlights the role of topological defects in generating the motion of these strutures.
