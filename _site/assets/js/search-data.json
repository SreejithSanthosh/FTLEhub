    "content": "To perform the Lagrangian analysis, we require the velocity field \\(\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) that quantifies the material flow on a manifold \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{M}(t)\\). The Lagrangian Analysis method that we describe here works well for both static surfaces, where the manifold on which the flow happens is time-independent, and dynamic surfaces, where the manifold on which the flow happens is time-dependent. NOTE: Obtaining velocity data from tissue mechanics and active nematic simulations is relatively simple, but obtaining them from experimental live imaging of biological systems is more difficult. Several methods exist to extract this information, such as ImSAnE and TubULAR. The manifold information \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is stored as a mesh with discrete node points \\(\\mathbf{x}_i = [x_i,y_i,z_i] \\in \\mathcal{R}^3\\) , where \\(i \\in \\{1,N_p(t)\\}\\) and \\(N_p(t)\\) is total number of nodes on the manifold at time \\(t\\). The connectivity of the mesh is given by a triangulation \\(T\\) which is a set of all the mesh faces, [THIS FOLLOWING SENTENCE IS UNCLEAR (SPLIT IT IN A STANDALONE SENTENCE)] which for say face \\(i \\in \\{1,N_f(t)\\}\\) would be another set of three vertices \\(\\{i_1,i_2,i_3\\}\\) where \\(i_1,i_2,i_3 \\in \\{1,N_p(t)\\}\\) are the indices of the nodes that form face \\(i\\), where \\(N_f(t)\\) is the total number of faces on the mesh at time \\(t\\).

Before you run the Lagrangian analysis, the velocity field data and the manifold on which it is defined need to be stored in a .mat file to be read by the MATLAB code, where the variables are . | x : cell array of size (\\(N_t,1\\)), where the cell array element x{i} \\(i\\in \\{1,N_t\\}\\) is a double array of size \\((N_p(i),1)\\) with the x-coordinate \\(x_i\\) of all the mesh nodes, where \\(N_p(i)\\) is the total number of points on the manifold at \\(t = i\\). | y : cell array of size (\\(N_t,1\\)), where the cell array element y{i} \\(i\\in \\{1,N_t\\}\\) is a double array of size \\((N_p(i),1)\\) with the y-coordinate \\(y_i\\) of all the mesh nodes, where \\(N_p(i)\\) is the total number of points on the manifold at \\(t = i\\). | z : cell array of size (\\(N_t,1\\)), where the cell array element z{i} \\(i\\in \\{1,N_t\\}\\) is a double array of size \\((N_p(i),1)\\) with the z-coordinate \\(z_i\\) of all the mesh nodes, where \\(N_p(i)\\) is the total number of points on the manifold at \\(t = i\\).

An example dataset is given in ./Data/staticMesh.mat in the code directory, which can be visualized by running the code ./Data/vizExampleData.m. NOTE: An accurate Lagrangian Analysis requires that the mesh representation of the manifold is sampled uniformly, whereby the mesh faces are approximately of equal size; deviation from this may result in spurious results. The finer the mesh faces, the better the accuracy of the advection and deformation computed. If the original data does not meet this requirement, remeshing is recommended. ",

    "content": "Coherent Structures are persistent, robust structures in a flow that summarize complex fluid trajectories and material deformations [1]. Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) [1] summarize material transport over a finite time interval. Eulerian Coherent Structures [2], on the other hand, do so over short-time intervals. Different methods have been proposed in the literature to compute these structures from flow data (see e.g. [3]). Here, we adopt Coherent Structures based on the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) and instantaneous Lyapunov Exponents [4] fields, which are the most common due to their simplicity and straightforward visualization. The FTLE is computed from the Lagrangian deformation generated by the flow and is objective; i.e., it is invariant to time-dependent rotations and translations of the coordinate system used to describe motion.

    "content": "The FTLE helps identify the finite-time analogues of the stable and unstable manifolds which are called hyperbollic coherent structures, thereby providing a reduced representation of a temporally and spatially varying flow (See panel (a) in figure above). The reduced representation therefore enables a systematic comparison between flows in different experimental setups and with different theoretical model of the flow. Coherent structures also provides a simplified understanding of the flow geometry, which aids in the study of funtion of flows generated, such as in morphogenesis where material transport is important. Though FTLE was developed to analyze atmospheric and oceanic flows, recent work have demonstrated the usefulness of analyzing active flows generated by biological systems through a coherent structures framework (See panel (b) in figure above). See the link for a detailed list of papers using the ideas of coherent structures in addressing questions in biology.

This is opposed to the sparse FTLE codes where particles are placed arbitrarily in space. This uniform grid structure is useful when: . | A global picture of the entire velocity field is desired. | The velocity data itself is sparse but the user wants a continuous FTLE field. | It simplifies the FTLE computation using finite-difference schemes. | . The primary functions of interest for dense FTLE computations are: . | FTLE_2d_dense — for dense FTLE computation in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. | FTLE_3d_dense — for dense FTLE computation in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. | . Example Usage . A typical workflow using FTLE_2d_dense looks like this: . from ftle.flat.dense import FTLE_2d_dense ftle_values, trajectories = FTLE_2d_dense( velocity_points, velocity_vectors, x_grid, y_grid, dt, initial_time, final_time, time_steps, direction, time_indepedent=False, plot_ftle=True ) .

Inputs . | x_grid, y_grid, z_grid: 3D arrays from np.meshgrid. | All other inputs are the same as FTLE_2d_dense. | . FTLE Computation Methodology . The FTLE computation for dense grids uses a finite difference scheme to compute the deformation gradient tensor $\\partial X_f / \\partial X_0$. | For 2D: This is done in FTLE_2d_compute. | For 3D: This is done in FTLE_3d_compute. | .

    "content": "Overview . This section provides functionality for computing FTLE (Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent) fields for flows on triangulated surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This is distinct from the dense and sparse FTLE methods in Euclidean domains, as here the mesh itself evolves over time and particles are constrained to remain on the surface throughout the advection process. The primary function for users is FTLE_mesh, which wraps the entire process of particle advection and FTLE computation for a triangulated, staggered mesh surface. Additional functions such as FTLE_compute are available if finer control is needed (e.g. using your own advection scheme or particle data). Example Usage . The function FTLE_mesh uses the input mesh data with a defined vector field data for the mesh to advect particles constrained to the mesh and to compute the FTLE values at each initial particle position. The mesh does not need any specific structure and the mesh itself can move over time and have a different number of nodes per time step. The advection scheme used is a standard RK4 scheme and KDtrees are used to assist in the projecting particles down to the surface after each time step. It is worth noting that due to the general design of FTLE_mesh to work with meshes that are not well defined over time(different number of nodes per time step), the RK4 integration time step is just set to \\(dt=1\\)(i.e the assumed difference between time steps in the mesh data). FTLE_mesh returns the FTLE data along with the trajectory data. Also FTLE_mesh has built in plotting functionality in a function plot_FTLE_mesh which is discussed more in a later section. from ftle.curved.mesh import ftle_mesh ftle_values , trajectories = def FTLE_mesh( node_connections, # List[np.ndarray], each (M_t, 3) node_positions, # List[np.ndarray], each (N_t, 3) node_velocities, # List[np.ndarray], each (N_t, 3) particle_positions, # (P, 3) initial_time, # int final_time, # int time_steps, # (T,) direction=\"forward\", # \"forward\" or \"backward\" plot_ftle=False, # If True, calls plot_ftle_mesh save_path = None, camera_setup = None, neighborhood=15, # For FTLE computation lam=1e-10 # Regularization ): . Inputs for ftle_mesh . The ftle_mesh function computes the FTLE field for flows on a triangulated surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. It takes the following inputs: . | node_cons A list of arrays of shape (M_t, 3) for each time step. Each array describes the mesh connectivity at that time step, where M_t is the number of faces at time t. | node_positions A list of arrays of shape (N_t, 3) for each time step, where N_t is the number of nodes at time t. These are the spatial coordinates of the mesh nodes. | node_velocities A list of arrays of shape (N_t, 3) for each time step. These are the velocity vectors at each node. | particle_positions An array of shape (P, 3) containing the initial positions of the particles to advect on the surface, where P is the number of particles, for ease of plotting the final results it is recommended that the initial positions just correspond to the node positions at the initial time. | initial_time An integer specifying the starting time index for the advection. This must respect final time with respect to the direction(‘forward’/’backward’) i.e if direction is ‘backward’ then initial_time $&gt;$ final_time. Just reverse the inequality for ‘forward’. | final_time An integer specifying the ending time index for the advection. This must respect final time with respect to the direction(‘forward’/’backward’) i.e if direction is ‘backward then initial_time $&gt;$ final_time. Just reverse the inequality for ‘forward’. | time_steps An array of time values corresponding to the available mesh data which should be orgainized as consecutive integers starting at 0. | direction A string, either \"forward\" or \"backward\" indicating the direction of advection. | plot_ftle Optional boolean. If True, automatically generates a 3D PyVista plot of the FTLE field. This does not save the plot. | save_path Optional string. If plot_ftle is true then having a save path specified will save the 3d plot in that directory. Take note that if a save path is given the PyVista plotting window will not appear due to PyVista plots having to be saved off screen. | camera_setup Optional tuple: (camera position, focal point, camera roll). | neighborhood Integer (default 15). The number of nearest neighboring particles used when computing the local FTLE gradient. | lam Regularization parameter (default $1 \\times 10^{-10}$). Helps stabilize the least-squares fit of the deformation gradient in regions with near-linear configurations. | . Inputs for FTLE_compute . The FTLE_compute function computes FTLE values directly given initial and final particle positions. It can be imported directly from ftle.curved.mesh import FTLE_compute This is useful if: . | You already have your own particle trajectories(like what is returned from ftle_mesh). | You want to bypass ftle_mesh and just compute FTLE. | . Here are the expected inputs . ftle.curved.mesh import FTLE_compute ftle_values = def FTLE_mesh( node_connections, # List[np.ndarray], each (M_t, 3) node_positions, # List[np.ndarray], each (N_t, 3) node_velocities, # List[np.ndarray], each (N_t, 3) particle_positions, # (P, 3) initial_time, # int final_time, # int time_steps, # (T,) direction=\"forward\", # \"forward\" or \"backward\" plot_ftle=False, # If True, calls plot_ftle_mesh save_path = None, camera_setup = None, neighborhood=15, # For FTLE computation lam=1e-10 # Regularization ): . | node_cons A list of arrays of shape (M_t, 3) for each time step. Each array describes the mesh connectivity at that time step, where M_t is the number of faces at time t. | node_positions A list of arrays of shape (N_t, 3) for each time step, where N_t is the number of nodes at time t. These are the spatial coordinates of the mesh nodes. | centroids A list of arrays of triangle centroids for each time step. These can be generated using the helper function compute_centroids_staggered. | initial_positions A (P, 3) array containing the positions of particles at the initial time step. | final_positions A (P, 3) array containing the positions of particles at the final time step. | initial_time Integer index specifying the start time. | final_time Integer index specifying the end time. | neighborhood The number of neighboring particles to use for local FTLE estimation. Defaults to 15. | lam A small regularization constant (default $1 \\times 10^{-10}$) used to stabilize the inversion of matrices during gradient estimation. | . Inputs for plot_FTLE_mesh . The plot_FTLE_mesh function can be called directly by importing it from ftle.curved.utilities import plot_FTLE_mesh. Here are the expected inputs: . from ftle.curved.utilities import plot_FTLE_mesh def plot_FTLE_mesh( node_cons, node_positions, initial_time, final_time, ftle, direction, save_path=None, # Optional: str or None camera_setup=None # Optional: tuple (position, focal_point, roll) ): . | node_cons A list of arrays of shape (M_t, 3) for each time step. Each array describes the mesh connectivity at that time step, where M_t is the number of faces at time t. | node_positions A list of arrays of shape (N_t, 3) for each time step, where N_t is the number of nodes at time t. These are the spatial coordinates of the mesh nodes. | initial_time An integer specifying the starting time index for the advection. This must respect final time with respect to the direction(‘forward’/’backward’) i.e if direction is ‘backward’ then initial_time $&gt;$ final_time. Just reverse the inequality for ‘forward’. | final_time An integer specifying the ending time index for the advection. This must respect final time with respect to the direction(‘forward’/’backward’) i.e if direction is ‘backward then initial_time $&gt;$ final_time. Just reverse the inequality for ‘forward’. | ftle A one dimensional list corresponding to the amount of nodes at time, initial_time. | direction A string, either \"forward\" or \"backward\" indicating the direction of advection. | save_path Optional string. If plot_ftle is true then having a save path specified will save the 3d plot in that directory. Take note that if a save path is given the PyVista plotting window will not appear due to PyVista plots having to be saved off screen. | camera_setup Optional tuple: (camera position, focal point, camera roll). | . When no save_path is specified then you can press ‘c’ in the PyVista plotting window to display needed information to specifiy camera_setup with respect to your current camera view in the PyVista plotting window.
