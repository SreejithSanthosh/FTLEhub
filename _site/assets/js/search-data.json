    "content": "To perform the Lagrangian analysis, we require the velocity field \\(\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) that quantifies the material flow on a manifold \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{M}(t)\\). The Lagrangian Analysis method that we describe here works well for both static surfaces, where the manifold on which the flow happens is time-independent, and dynamic surfaces, where the manifold on which the flow happens is time-dependent. NOTE: Obtaining velocity data from tissue mechanics and active nematic simulations is relatively simple, but obtaining them from experimental live imaging of biological systems is more difficult. Several methods exist to extract this information, such as ImSAnE and TubULAR. The manifold information \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is stored as a mesh with discrete node points \\(\\mathbf{x}_i = [x_i,y_i,z_i]\\) , where \\(i \\in \\{1,N_p(t)\\}\\) and \\(N_p(t)\\) is total number of nodes on the manifold at time \\(t\\). The connectivity of the mesh is given by a triangulation \\(T\\) which is a set of all the mesh faces. Each face \\(j \\in \\{1,N_f(t)\\}\\) consists of set of three nodes \\(\\{i_1,i_2,i_3\\}\\) that form face \\(j\\). \\(N_f(t)\\) denotes the total number of faces on the mesh at time \\(t\\). The velocity field is stored as \\(\\mathbf{v}_i(t) = [v_i^1(t),v_i^2(t),v_i^3(t)]\\) where \\(v_i^1(t),v_i^2(t)\\) and \\(v_i^3(t)\\) are the x,y and z-component of the velocity at node \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\). Before you run the Lagrangian analysis, the velocity field data and the manifold on which it is defined need to be stored in a .mat file to be read by the MATLAB code, where the variables are . | time : vector of size (\\(1,N_t\\)), where \\(N_t\\) is the number of time points of the dataset. | x : cell array of size (\\(N_t,1\\)). Each cell array element x{k} \\(k\\in \\{1,N_t\\}\\) is vector of size \\((N_p(k),1)\\) containing the x-coordinate of all the \\((N_p(k)\\) mesh nodes, where \\(N_p(k)\\) is the total number mesh nodes at \\(t = k\\). Similarly, the y and z components of the mesh nodes are stored in y and z. | TrianT : cell array of size (\\(N_t,1\\)). The cell array element TrianT{k} \\(k\\in \\{1,N_t\\}\\) is a matrix of size \\((N_f(k),3)\\) whose \\(j-th\\) raw contains the mesh connectivity of face \\(j\\) (e.g. \\([i_1,i_2,i_3]\\) for a mesh face with nodes \\(i_1,i_2,i_3\\)). \\(N_f(k)\\) denotes the number of mesh faces at time \\(t = k\\). | v : cell array of size (\\(3, N_t\\)) , where the cell array element v{1,k} \\(k\\in \\{1,N_t\\}\\) is a matrix of size \\((N_p(k),1)\\) with the x-component of the velocity all the mesh nodes. \\(N_p(k)\\) is the total number of mesh nodes at \\(t = k\\). Similarly, the y and z components of the velocity are stored in v{2,k} and v{3,k}. | . An example dataset is provided in ./Data/growingSphere.mat in the code directory, which can be visualized by running ./Data/vizExampleData.m. NOTE: An accurate Lagrangian Analysis requires that the mesh representation of the manifold is sampled uniformly, whereby the mesh faces are approximately of equal size; deviation from this may result in spurious results. The finer the mesh faces, the better the accuracy of the advection and deformation computed. If the original data does not meet this requirement, remeshing is recommended. ",

    "content": "We now explain how to run the code main.m to compute the Lagrangian deformation information for a chosen time interval \\([t0,tf]\\). | Load the data : Once the data is formatted appropriately as described above, it can be loaded onto the script by providing the right path load(PATH TO THE DATA FILE); Nt = size(time,2); . | Setting parameters for the simulation : A few parameters need to be set depending on the type of data and the system configuration on which you are running the script: . | isStatic : should be set to isStatic = 1 if the mesh surface on which the motion happens is time-independent and isStatic = 0 if the mesh changes over time. The code runs faster for static meshes. | cpu_num : The code parallelizes the Lagrangian analysis using the parfor method. Therefore, set this variable to cpu_num = Nc, where \\(Nc\\) is the number of CPU cores available. Note that a copy of the dataset is sent to each core, which may cause the total data in RAM to exceed the systemâ€™s capabilities.

Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) [1] summarize material transport over a finite time interval. Eulerian Coherent Structures [2], on the other hand, do so over short-time intervals. There exist different types of Coherent Structures and different methods for computing them from velocity or trajectory flow data (see, e.g., [3]). Here, we focus on Attracting and Repelling Coherent Structuresâ€”special surfaces in 3D flows or curves in 2D flows where nearby tracer particles maximally converge or separate. We identify Attracting and Repelling Coherent Structures based on the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) and instantaneous Lyapunov Exponents [4] fields, which are the most common due to their simplicity and straightforward visualization.

    "title": "Why is coherent structure identification useful?",
    "content": "Consider the flow field around a saddle point (Panel (a)): a nearby patch of fluid (cyan) converges to the fixed point along its stable manifold (red curve) and separates along the unstable manifold (blue curve). Stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points, however, have important limitations: i) are meaningful only in steady velocities (\\(\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x})\\)); ii) describe the evolution of material patches only in the infinite-time limit (not over finite or short times); iii) are static (do not deform/move in time). Repelling and Attracting LCSs generalize stable and unstable manifolds of fixed points, overcoming the above limitations. i) They are computable for both steady and unsteady (\\(\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\)) velocity fields; ii) they shape material patches over the desired time interval of interest \\([t_0, t]\\); iii) they are dynamic (move and deform over time); iv) they reveal regions on the flow with the highest Lagrangian deformations; v) they are objective; i.e., invariant to time-dependent rotations and translations of the coordinate system used to describe motion. Overall, Repelling and Attracting LCSs provide a reduced representation of a temporally and spatially varying flow, enabling robust quantification of complex and noisy velocity datasets, a systematic comparison between flows in different experiments and comparisons with theoretical models. Coherent structures also provide a simplified understanding of flow geometry, identify dynamic domain boundaries, and provide a new perspective for optimal flow control. While Coherent Structures were initially motivated to analyze atmospheric and oceanic flows, recent works have demonstrated their utility in studying biological systems and active matter, see e.g. panels (e-g) above and examples of recent papers [8-13] summarized here.

    "title": "How to calculate FTLE?",
    "content": "Finite-Time-Lyapunov-Exponents enable identifying Repelling and Attracting LCSs as ridges (or regions with high FTLE values) of a scalar field. We describe how to compute FTLE and Attracting/Repelling LCSs for a 2D flow described by the velocity field \\(\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\). For the formalism to compute FTLE for flows on 2D curved surfaces embedded in 3D, please refer to [8]. We assume a simulated or measured velocity field is given. If one needs to reconstruct the velocity from experimental flow data, Particle Image Velocimetry methods are common (See Ref, and PIVLab is a MATLAB toolbox). To study the Lagrangian features of the flow, we compute the flow (or trajectory) map . $$ \\mathbf{F}_{t_0}^t(\\mathbf{x}_0) = \\mathbf{x}_0 + \\int_{t_0}^t \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{F}_{t_0}^\\tau(\\mathbf{x}_0),\\tau) d\\tau,$$ that maps initial positions \\((\\mathbf{x}_0)\\) at \\(t_0\\) to their time \\(t\\) position \\(\\mathbf{F}_{t_0}^t(\\mathbf{x}_0)\\). The deformation gradient \\(\\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{x}_0}\\mathbf{F}_{t_0}^t(\\mathbf{x}_0))\\) quantifies derivatives of the flow map with respect to small changes in initial conditions and is represented as a 2x2 matrix for any \\((\\mathbf{x}_0)\\) and time interval \\([t_0,t]\\). The FTLE field is given by . $$ \\Lambda_{t_0}^t(\\mathbf{x}_0) = \\frac{1}{|t-t_0|}\\text{log}(\\lambda_2(\\mathbf{x}_0)),$$ where \\(\\lambda_2(\\mathbf{x}_0)\\) is the largest singular eigenvalue of \\(\\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\mathbf{x}_0}\\mathbf{F}_{t_0}^t(\\mathbf{x}_0))\\). High \\(\\lambda_2(\\mathbf{x}_0)\\) (or \\(\\Lambda_{t_0}^t(\\mathbf{x}_0)\\)) mark initial fluid positions \\((\\mathbf{x}_0)\\) where initially close tracers will highly separate by time \\(t\\) (left panel). Repelling LCSs are identified by ridges (i.e. regions of high values) of the \\(\\Lambda_{t_0}^t(\\mathbf{x}_0)\\) (or \\(_{f}\\Lambda\\)) computed from trajectories in forward time (left panel). By contrast, Attracting LCSs are identified by ridges (i.e. regions of high values) of the \\(\\Lambda_{t}^{t_0}(\\mathbf{x}_t)\\) (or \\(_{b}\\Lambda\\)) computed from trajectories in backward time (right panel). Attracting LCSs locate the final positions \\((\\mathbf{x}_t)\\) where initially distinct tracers will maximally converge. ",
